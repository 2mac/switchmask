SwitchMask
==========

Manage your identity.

Why?
----

I'm lazy. I like roleplaying on the DarkMyst IRC network, but I don't like
changing my nick for a character, since that can make me hard to find if I'm
switching roles. Instead, I wanted an easy way to prepend my character's name
to my messages for certain channels.

How?
----

Masks are stored on a per-channel basis. To set the mask for the current
channel, use:

    /mask Herp

To remove the mask for the current channel, use:

    /unmask
